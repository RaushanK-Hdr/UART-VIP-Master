# UART VIP
Developed the UVM based verification environment for the UART IP from scratch for the top-level verification. Created the constraint-random and achieved functional coverage greater than 85% with 9 different test cases.

TEST CASES:-

  1. Full duplex
  2. Half duplex
  3. Loopback
  4. Parity error
  5. Overrun error
  6. Frame mismatch
  7. Break interrupt
  8. Timeout
  9. thr empty
